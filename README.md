# Bike Sales Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of customer data to identify trends and patterns in bike purchases. Using **Microsoft Excel**, the data was cleaned, transformed, and visualized to provide actionable insights into customer demographics such as income levels, age groups, and commute distances.

## 📊 Key Features
- **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and standardized categorical data (e.g., converting 'M'/'S' to 'Married'/'Single' and 'M'/'F' to 'Male'/'Female').
- **Data Transformation:** Created custom age brackets (Adolescent, Middle Age, Old) to better categorize the customer base.
- **Pivot Tables:** Aggregated data to analyze average income per purchase and count of purchases based on commute distance and region.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Built a dynamic dashboard featuring:
  - Average Income per Purchase (Bar Chart)
  - Customer Age Brackets (Line Chart)
  - Customer Commute Distance (Line Chart)
  - **Slicers:** Interactive filters for Marital Status, Region, and Education.

## 📁 Repository Structure
- `Bike Sales Project.xlsx`: The main Excel workbook containing the raw data, working sheet, pivot tables, and the final dashboard.
- `bike_buyers.csv`: The cleaned dataset used for analysis.

## 🔍 Key Insights
- **Income Influence:** On average, customers who purchased bikes have a higher income than those who did not.
- **Commute Distance:** Customers living within 0-1 miles are the most frequent bike buyers.
- **Age Demographics:** The "Middle Aged" group (31-54) represents the largest segment of bike purchasers.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `Bike Sales Project.xlsx` file.
3. Navigate to the **Dashboard** tab.
